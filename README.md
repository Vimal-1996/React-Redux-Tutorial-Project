The Project "React-Redux-Tutorial-Project" works as a beginner project who wants to learn React along Redux library.

Some of the major React Ideas illustrated in this project includes:
  1. React Components
  2. React Hooks
  3. UseState Hook
  4. UseEffect Hook
  5. React Redux
  6. Rexux thunk
  7. Middlewares
  8. Reducers and Store

The Projects works in a simple way where an API call to a fakeApi using axios library is performed. Upon successfull response from the the API, Redux library is used for state management using actions and reducers. 
An Idea of Redux store is also implemented to view all the states.
